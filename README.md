# primitivepyg

Pyglet is a wonderful Python module for creating graphical applications such as simulations and games, but a common inconvenience is the difficulty of drawing simple shapes.  To make it easier, I created primitivepyg which allows you to draw anti-aliased 2D primitives in a simple and intuitive way to pyglet batches, all while keeping your OpenGL state nice and clean.
