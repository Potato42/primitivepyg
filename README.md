# primitivepyg

Pyglet is a wonderful Python module for creating graphical applications such as simulations and games, but a common inconvenience is the difficulty of drawing simple shapes.  To make it easier, I created primitivepyg which allows you to draw 2D primitives in an intuitive way to pyglet batches, all while keeping your OpenGL state nice and clean.

Example of primitivepyg (expanded to fill area):  
<img src="demo.bmp" width="100%" alt="Some shapes" title="This is what it looks like!" />
